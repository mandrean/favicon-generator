# favicon-generator
Favicons generator for Node.js using ImageMagick.

Unlike [RealFaviconGenerator](github.com/RealFaviconGenerator/real-favicon), this doesn't rely on a potentially slow web service. It's done super-fast & locally using ImageMagick (https://www.npmjs.com/package/imagemagick).

Built to be compatible with [favicons](https://github.com/haydenbleasel/favicons) and [gulp-favicons](https://github.com/haydenbleasel/gulp-favicons).
